# Hacker Terminal Age Calculator

This project is a simple, front-end only age calculator styled to look like a retro "hacker" terminal. Instead of a standard form, it presents a fictional system breach scenario with animated text and a countdown timer that reloads the page.

## Description

The primary goal of this project was to create a visually engaging and unique user interface with a "hacker" theme. It leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce a terminal-like appearance, complete with a flickering CRT effect, a typing animation, and ASCII art.

The core "functionality" is the presentation itself. A message types out on the screen, simulating a system access log. This is followed by a countdown, after which the page automatically reloads, restarting the animation sequence.

## Features

*   **Retro Hacker Theme:** The entire page is styled to mimic a classic computer terminal, using a monospace font (`VT323`), a black background, and bright green text.
*   **CRT Scanlines Effect:** A CSS overlay simulates the scanlines of an old CRT monitor for added visual authenticity.
*   **Typing Animation:** JavaScript is used to create a typing effect, revealing a message character by character.
*   **Countdown Timer:** A simple countdown script that reloads the page when it reaches zero.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive and centers well on different screen sizes.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  Watch the animation and the countdown.
3.  The page will automatically reload upon completion of the countdown.

*   HTML5
